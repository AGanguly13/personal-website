I often struggled to find a reason to build a website. I was never very interested in front-end development, so I didn’t think it was worth my time. Recently, though, I’ve done a complete 180—not because I’ve suddenly developed a passion for TypeScript or a desire to create a glamorous website from scratch.

Rather, I just want to build.

For so long, especially early on in college, I was focused on chasing impressive internships and grinding LeetCode. But in doing so, I suppressed the innate curiosity and love for building that first drew me to computer science. I’ve realized how empty that chase felt. I find so much more satisfaction in writing code and creating something that is mine-something I can take pride in.

This website isn’t the final culmination of that desire. In fact, it’s simply based on a beautifully designed template, [nim](https://github.com/ibelick/nim). Still, adding to it and making it my own has been genuinely fun. It’s reminded me why I chose to study computer science in the first place.
