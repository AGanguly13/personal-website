I often struggled with finding a purpose to build a website. My interests have never lied in front end devlopment, so I never thought I should spend time making one. I have recently done a 180 on this thought, but not because of a newfound desire to be a frontend engineer or have a glamarous and built froms scratch website.

Rather, I just want to build.

As a student I always worried about how to be an ideal interviewer and how to do good on leetcode, but recently I have sort of realized how empty doing that is. I find so much more satisfaction from just writing code and building something that is mine, something I can take pride in. This website won't be the final culmination of that desire. In fact, it is a simply a wrapper around a beautfully desgined website template, nim. Still, adding to it and making this my own has been a thrilling experiencves, and has reminded me why I chose to study computer science in the first place: for the love of building.
